# FastAPI YOLOv8 Object Detection Service

A versatile service template for creating a real-time object detection service using YOLOv8 and FastAPI. This template allows you to quickly set up a robust and efficient object detection API powered by state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## Key Features

- **FastAPI**: Utilize FastAPI, a modern and high-performance web framework, to build a RESTful API for object detection.

- **YOLOv8**: YOLOv8, a popular and accurate object detection model, for real-time object detection tasks.

- **Dockerized**: Simplify deployment with Docker and Docker Compose. Run `docker-compose up`, and your object detection service is ready to go.

- **RESTful API**: Create a user-friendly and intuitive API for object detection, making it easy to integrate into various applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. On the root directory, run the following command to start the object detection service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
